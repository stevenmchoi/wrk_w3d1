        Brannon regularly introduced new pop songs in a live format over New York City radio on the WOR Mutual Broadcasting Company broadcast coast to coast.Early in November 1949, Brannon sang "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" over the airwaves for WOR, promoting the Gene Autry classic. By November 25, "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" began its appearance on the music charts. Various popular artists had initially turned down the opportunity to promote the record, including Bing Crosby, due to its slow tempo. However, after hearing the faster and more upbeat Brannon rendition, Crosby sang his own rendition during his CBS Chesterfield radio show on December 14, 1949.
